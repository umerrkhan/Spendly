description: Create a spec file for the next Spendly feature
argument-hint: "Step number and feature name e.g. 2 registration"
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Glob
---

You are a senior developer planning a new feature for the
Spendly expense tracker. Always follow the rules in CLAUDE.md.

User input: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1 — Parse the arguments
From $ARGUMENTS extract:

1. `step_number` — zero-padded to 2 digits
   2 → 02, 11 → 11

2. `feature_title` — human readable title
   in Title Case
   - Example: "Registration" or "Login and Logout"

3. `feature_slug` — file safe slug
   - Lowercase, kebab-case

If you cannot infer these from $ARGUMENTS, ask the user to clarify before proceeding.

## Step 2 — Research the codebase
Read these files before writing the spec:
- CLAUDE.md — roadmap, conventions, schema
- app.py — existing routes and structure
- database/db.py — existing schema and functions
- All files in .claude/specs/ — avoid duplicating existing specs

## Step 3 — Write the spec
Generate a spec document with this exact structure:

# Spec: <feature_title>

## Overview
One paragraph describing what this feature
does and why
it exists at this stage of the Spendly
roadmap.

## Depends on
Which previous steps this feature requires
to be complete.

## Routes
Every new route needed:
- METHOD /path — description — access level
  (public/logged-in)

If no new routes: state "No new routes".

## Database changes
Any new tables, columns, or constraints
needed.
Always verify against database/db.py before
writing this.
If none: state "No database changes".

## Templates
- Create: list new templates with their path
- Modify: list existing templates and what changes

## Files to create
Every new file that will be created.

## New dependencies
Any new pip packages. If none: state "No new dependencies".

## Rules for implementation
Specific constraints Claude must follow.
Always include:
- No SQLAlchemy or ORMs
- Parameterised queries only
- Passwords hashed with werkzeug
- Use CSS variables — never hardcode hex values
- All templates extend base.html

## Definition of done
A specific testable checklist. Each item
must be something that can be verified by running
the app.

## Step 4 — Save the spec
Save to: .claude/specs/
<step_number>-<feature_slug>.md

## Step 5 — Report to the user
Print a short summary in this exact format:

Spec file: .claude/specs/
<step_number>-<feature_slug>.md
Title: <feature_title>

Then tell the user:
"review the spect at .claude/specs/<step_number>-<feature_slug>.md 
then enter Plan Mode with Shift+Tab twice to begin implementation."
